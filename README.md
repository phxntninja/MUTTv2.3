## 🎯 Overview

MUTT provides a robust, fault-tolerant pipeline for processing network events from syslog and SNMP traps. It
intelligently routes events based on configurable rules, distinguishes between production and development
environments, and forwards alerts to downstream systems like Moogsoft.

### v2.5 Highlights
- **Dynamic Config**: Redis-backed runtime tuning with Pub/Sub invalidation
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, tracing, SLO endpoint and rules
- **Reliability**: Backpressure controls, remediation service, circuit breaker patterns
- **Compliance**: Audit logging, API versioning, retention automation and docs
- **DevEx**: `muttdev` CLI, ADRs, CI across OS/Python, quickstart docs

## 🧩 Components

MUTT is composed of four main services:

1.  **Ingestor Service**: Receives events from monitoring sources.
2.  **Alerter Service**: Processes events based on user-defined rules.
3.  **Moog Forwarder Service**: Forwards alerts to Moogsoft.
4.  **Web UI Service**: Provides a web interface for managing the system.

For more details on each component, see the [Components Overview](docs/code/MODULES.md).
